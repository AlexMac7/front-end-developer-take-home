Trackloop's Front End SPA Project
===

Hey Front End developer. Welcome. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to carve out 2 hours and complete the tasks outline below.

> **Hey this is important!**
> We hope you can spend about two hours on this project. If you can finish faster -- great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer than 2 hours MAX.

We've provided code for you to get up and running fast!  We encourage you to use it if you think it will help, but feel free to roll your own solution if you like.

Be creative with this, when in doubt, make an executive decision. *Functionality is more important than the look and feel*. If you finish early, feel free to polish it up.

# Your Tasks
* The App page shows a list of vehicles in an arbitrary company's fleet. There are buttons to CREATE a new vehicle that will be added to the list, RESET the form, and to DELETE a specific vehicle from the list.
* Your tasks are as follows,
    * Implement the RESET button functionality so the form is cleared when clicked
    * Show an alert if a form field is not present and prevent creating the vehicle
    * Dynamically increment the index for the vehicle before adding it to the vehicles object
    * Clear the form after the vehicle has been added to the vehicles object
    * Implement delete vehicle functionality for the DELETE button
    * Refactor the App so that two new components handle the table listing the vehicles, and the form for adding a new vehicle
* There are `TODO`'s inline to help direct you with the tasks
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) is being used for styling and has already been imported.
